# Lesson 01: What is Django?

## 🚀 Concept

*Django* is a powerful *web framework* written in Python. It helps you build websites — fast, clean, and secure.

## 🧠 Think of Django Like a Kitchen

Imagine you want to **bake a cake (your website)**. You could gather the tools and ingredients from scratch, but that takes time and effort.

Now imagine walking into a **professional kitchen (Django)**:
- The oven is preheated (built-in web server)
- Ingredients are ready (models, templates, views)
- Tools are organized (admin panel, routing, authentication)
- You just follow the recipe and focus on the fun part: **creating** 🍰

Django is that kitchen. It gives you the structure, tools, and shortcuts to build powerful web apps *without reinventing the wheel*.

## ⚙️ What Django Does for You

✅ Handles common web development tasks:
- Routing (what happens when you visit a URL)
- HTML templating (designing pages)
- Working with databases (storing data)
- User authentication (login/logout)
- Admin interface (manage content)
- Forms and validation

✅ Comes with batteries included:
> “Batteries included” means Django comes packed with features — no need to install a hundred extra tools just to get started.

✅ Written in Python:
If you know Python, you’re already halfway there!
