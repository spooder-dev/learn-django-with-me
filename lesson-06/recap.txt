✅ Recap

    Context lets you pass Python data into your templates

    It’s just a dictionary passed to render()

    Templates use {{ }} and {% %} to display and loop through data


#Take away!
    ✅ What is request?

request is Django’s way of saying:

    “Someone is visiting your website — here’s all the info about that visit.”

It includes:

    Who is visiting

    What page they want

    If they clicked a link, submitted a form, etc.

    ✅ How do render and request work together?

They work like a team:

    request tells Django what the user asked for

    render() uses that info to prepare and send the right webpage back
