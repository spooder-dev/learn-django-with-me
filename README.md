# 🌱 Learning Django from Scratch — With Me!

Welcome! This is a beginner-friendly guide to learning Django **step by step**, with simple explanations, relatable analogies, and practice code in every lesson.

Each lesson is in its **own Git branch**, so you can explore and learn at your own pace — one topic at a time.

## 💻 How to Use This Project (in Codespaces)

You don’t need to install anything on your computer.

Just use **GitHub Codespaces** (which runs in your browser).

### 🚀 To get started:

1. **Click the green `<> Code` button** at the top of this repo.
2. Choose **“Open with Codespaces”** → **“+ New codespace”**
3. Wait a few seconds — VS Code will open in your browser.

## 📦 Project Structure

- Each **lesson** is a Git **branch**
- The `main` branch is just an overview and table of contents
- All Django code is inside a project folder called `mysite/` and apps like `hello/`

---

## 🧭 How to Access a Lesson

### ▶️ In the terminal (inside Codespaces), type:

```bash
git checkout lesson-02-setup

Replace lesson-03-views with the branch name of the lesson you want to try.

You can run the Django server with:
python manage.py runserver
Then visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in the preview tab.
