## ðŸ§ª Try This

1. Open `settings.py` â€” find the `INSTALLED_APPS` list. See whatâ€™s already there.
2. Open `urls.py` â€” try adding a simple path like:
   ```python
   from django.urls import path
   from django.http import HttpResponse

   def home(request):
       return HttpResponse("Hello from your new project!")

   urlpatterns = [
       path("", home),
   ]
3. Runserver
python manage.py runserver

You should now see "Hello from your new project!" on the homepage.
